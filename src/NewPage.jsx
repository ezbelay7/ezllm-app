            <h1>Introduction to Neural Networks</h1>
            <p>A neural network is a computer system that's inspired by the way our brains work. Just like our brains have tiny cells called neurons that communicate with each other to process information, a neural network uses artificial neurons to process data. Each artificial neuron, like the one you see in the image, takes in information, processes it, and then passes it on to the next neuron. These neurons work together in layers, and they can learn and adapt over time, making neural networks really good at tasks like recognizing patterns in images, understanding spoken language, or making decisions based on data. So, think of a neural network as a digital brain that helps computers make sense of the world around them.</p>
